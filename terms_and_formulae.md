Terms and Formulae.
---
There are a fair number of domain specific terms to learn here, as well as several equations. This document serves as a reference sheet for the various acronyms and formulae covered in the course.

##### TVM - Time Value of Money
_"A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow."_

###### Compounding
- ***PV*** - Present Value
- ***FV*** - Future Value
- ***r*** - Interest Rate (per period)
- ***n*** - Number of periods

When we want to know how much something will be valued at after accruing interest for some amount of time, we use the above formula.

E.g. *"I have $100, and put it in an investment that pays 5% interest per years, I leave it for 5 years, what is the future value?"*

**FV = 100(1 + 0.05)^5 ≈ $127.63**

We can of course rearrange the formula to calculate what initial investment is needed to achieve a certain value.

![Present Value - Compound Interest](http://www.sciweavers.org/upload/Tex2Img_1673611570/eqn.png)

E.g. *"I want my day trading account to have $1000 in it after 6 months, I believe I can make 3% profit per month, how much do I need to invest?"*

**PV = 1000 / (1.03)^6 ≈ $837.48**
